        <h2>Rationale and Overview of Our Developmental Process</h2>

        <p>
          Your deployed web page should also include a write-up with the following components:
A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?
You can either include your write-up on the same page as your visualization or link to a separate file.
          </p>

          Rationale:
          </p>

        <p>
          Overview: We started by using Gabe’s GitHub as it made it easier for everyone else since it was already established. We used his new repository for Project 3, as it made the most sense since it was the first established. I did the write-ups for our group’s rationale and our overview in our process. Derrick and Jacob helped Gabe with the interactive visualization in D3, each contributing to its structure in their own ways. From the month slider that interacts with the visualization by selecting the particular month, to the overarching skeleton of the website, to the actual code behind our D3 interactive visualization, we split the work up into Derrick choosing the dataset for the question we are answering for our project, Logan creating the question for our project, Gabe figuring out the code for creating the graphs for each month in our Latitude vs. Surface Temperature data, and myself for summarizing our rationale and our overview. We spent a total of 6 hours developing the portfolio, gathering the data, creating a question, creating the webpage, creating the visualization from D3 interactive code, and a total of 2 hours writing the summaries of our rationale and overview. Choosing the right dataset and creating the visualization using D3, a language we have just so recently learned, was easily the hardest part because we had to quickly familiarize ourselves with the code to do so, in the midst of many midterms and other obligations that all of our group members had. It was definitely a time crunch and a challenge, but we were able to come through and finish the project because of our group chemistry and efficient communication with one another.
